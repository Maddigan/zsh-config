DISCLAIMER
==========

This is my private repository with my Z-Shell configuration files. I've made it
public but I may do things not tolerable in a public repo, so expect some force
pushes, rebases, etc. from time to time.

I've been trying to keep the original authors and/or sources of some snippets I
have included in my configs but it's easy to forget about some of them
(especially the old ones as I started doing it only relatively recently). If you
find your code here without such comment and feel it's infringing your rights,
please contact me. I mean no harm.
